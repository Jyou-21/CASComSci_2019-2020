## TODO

- Open the iOS app project `ScheduleSaver`.
- Read through the code in the project.
- With your classmates, answer the following questions:
  - Where does the saved schedule data live in the phone?
    - What is the name of the file?
    - What is the format of the file?
  - What kind of class does `ScheduleItem` define?
    - What protocol does the class have?
  - What function loads the saved data?
    - What is it named, and what file is it defined in?
    - What user action triggers it to be called? In other words, where in the program is it used?
    - Is this a "safe" function? In other words, could it cause the program to crash when it's called?
    - What does it do if the save file doesn't exist?
    - What happens in the application (not just in this function) if there is no save file?
  - What function saves the user's entered data?
    - What is it named, and what file is it defined in?
    - What user action triggers it to be called? In other words, where in the program is it used?
