## Concepts

- Using constraints to design for different devices

## TODO

- Build an application with a single view controller that has four labels and one button.
- Fill the entire screen with these labels and buttons.
  - It may be helpful to give them background colors so you can easily see exactly how big they are.
- Check how it looks on different devices.
  - Run the application on the iPhone 11 Pro Max simulator.
  - Run the application on the iPhone 8 simulator.
  - Run the application on the iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (3rd generation) simulator.
- Use constraints to ensure that the labels and buttons always fill the entire screen (and no more).
- Use constraints to ensure that the labels and buttons' sizes relative to one another are always the same.
  - That is to say, if the button is twice as big as each label, it should _always_ be twice as big as each label.
- Check how it looks on different devices again.
- Share students' solutions.
