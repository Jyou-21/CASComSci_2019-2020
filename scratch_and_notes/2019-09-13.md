## Concepts

- Types, including optionals
- Functions
- Xcode storyboards

## TODO

- Warmup: Write a function called `classifyProduct` that takes two integers, multiplies them, and returns a string based on the product:
  - Return "small" if the product is positive and less than 30.
  - Return "big" if the product is greater than or equal to 30.
  - Return "zero" if the product is zero.
  - Return "negative" if the product is less than zero.
- Run the `helloApp` iOS app code in Xcode using Simulator.
  - Review the structure of an iOS app's files.
  - Read the Swift code in the Controller.
  - Look through the structure of the Storyboard.
- Begin creating an app that asks the user for their age, then says what year they were born.
  - Bonus: Include a checkbox if they have already had their birthday this year.
