We'll finish the Notes app today—for real—and then we'll review some of the concepts and moving parts of a table view application.

## Concepts

- Defining the behaviors of a table view application.
- Passing data between view controllers.
- Encapsulating data and behaviors in a class.

## TODO

- Finish the Notes application.
- Take the check for understanding.
- Review concepts of table view applications.
  - Fill out the [BlankTableViewController](https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/CASComSci_2019-2020/blob/7538aaf/scratch_and_notes/EmptyTableViewController.swift) with descriptions of what each function is responsible for.
