We've been practicing building these applications that use table views and navigation controllers for a couple of weeks now. Up to this point, you've been building applications with the designs predefined. Now it's time to build an application of your own design.

You will design your own application and build it this week. This will be the last project of the trimester.

We will have a quiz tomorrow to assess your handle on the behaviors of table view applications.

## Understandings

- Defining the behaviors of a table view application.
- Passing data between view controllers.
- Encapsulating data and behaviors in a class.

## TODO

- Finish the notes application.
  - Allow the user to edit an existing note.
    - Make sure loading an existing note works.
    - Write the code for saving a note when closing it.
  - Allow the user to create a new note.
    - Adjust the `prepare` behavior to create a new `Note` object when the button for a new note is clicked.
- Review concepts for the quiz tomorrow.
- Come up with designs for a new application to build this week.
  - Work in pairs or on your own.
  - Define the features of your application. Have Riley or Paul sign off on them.
    - The application must include a table view.
    - Clicking an item in the table view must open a new view controller.
    - The data or behavior of the new view controller must be influenced or defined by which row was clicked in the table.
- Exit ticket/check for understanding.
