Happy Friday the 13th! I'm not superstitious, but I do like prime numbers.

We're going to go ahead with trying out asynchronous data fetching today.

## Concepts

- Closures in Swift.
- Defining tasks using closures.
- Using `DispatchQueue.async()` to schedule tasks.
- Using `URLSession.shared.dataTask(with:)` to create tasks.

## TODO

- Review Part II of last class's Check for Understanding.
- Demo the difference in performance between synchronous and asynchronous data fetching.
- Write our first closures.
- Schedule tasks in closures.
