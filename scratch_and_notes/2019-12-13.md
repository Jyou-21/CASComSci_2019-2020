Happy Friday the 13th! I'm not superstitious, but I do like prime numbers.

We're going to go ahead with trying out asynchronous data fetching today.

## Concepts

- Closures in Swift.
- Defining tasks using closures.
- Using `DispatchQueue.async()` to schedule tasks.
- Using `URLSession.shared.dataTask(with:)` to create tasks.

## TODO

- Review Part II of last class's Check for Understanding.
- Demo the difference in performance between synchronous and asynchronous data fetching.
- Write our first closures.
- Schedule tasks in closures.
  - See [asyncExperiments](https://github.com/rileyjohngibbs/CASComSci_2019-2020/blob/891b762/scratch_and_notes/2019-12-11_asyncExperiments.playground/Contents.swift) for an example of how to do async with `DispatchQueue` and `URLSession`.
