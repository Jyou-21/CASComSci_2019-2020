Time to pull in data from SWAPI! Today's goal will be to fetch data from SWAPI with Swift. Parsing won't be the focus of today's lesson, but we're still going to do some of it using the same techniques we learned last class with `JSONSerialization.jsonObject` and downcasting.

We're going to try to be a little more responsible with our code today, because there's a lot more that's out of our control when we're developing against a web API. What if your network goes down? What if the website isn't working? What if the maintainers of that external API suddenly changed the way the API works and you didn't update your code yet?

We'll also look at how to make many calls simply but slowly, and how to make many calls with a little more coding on our part, but a lot faster, using something called asynchronous programming.

## Concepts

- Parsing JSON data in Swift.
- Fetching data from remote (internet) APIs.
- Asynchronous programming in Swift with `URLSessionDataTask`.

## TODO

- What could go wrong?
  - How status codes indicate success or failure of a network call.
  - Use `curl -i [url]` to see the status codes of good and bad calls.
    - `curl -i "https://swapi.co/api/people/1/"`
    - `curl -i "https://swapi.co/api/people/0/"`
    - `curl -i "https://swapi.co/api/people/1"`
- Synchronous data fetching:
  - Completes each call in sequence, i.e. one at a time.
  - Not great for app development.
- Asycnchronous data fetching:
  - Runs all of the calls at the same time while other things are going on.
  - Much better for app development.
  - Uses a closure (like an anonymous function) to define how to handle a call to a URL.
