## Concepts

- `UITableView` components
- Swift `protocol`s
- `prepare` method when changing views

## Notes

- Notes App Clone
  - There are several `tableView` methods defined in the `UITableViewController`.
    - How can they be told apart when they share a name?
    - What do they each do?
  - Transitions between table view and note view.
    - How many ways are there to transition from the table view to the note view? How are they defined?
    - How many ways are there to transition from the note view to the table view? How are they defined?
  - The model.
    - What is the `Note` class? What does it store for us?
    - Where is the list of notes being stored in the model (i.e. what is the name of the variable/constant)?
  - Interactions between the view and the model in the controller.
    - Where is the identifier for the table view's prototype cell used in the code?
    - What happens when a table cell is deleted? Where is that behavior defined?
    - What user action prompts the creation of a new `Note`? Where is that behavior defined?
    - What user action prompts the update of a note?
