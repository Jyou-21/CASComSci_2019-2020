This trimester we're going to learn about ways to handle data in our application. We'll fetch that data from web APIs using the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data format, as well as save and retrieve data to an iOS device's file system, so that we can have the same data persist across sessions of using the app.

Today, we'll start with looking at what [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is, using the open Star Wars API, or [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/). If you're feeling ambitious, you can also do similarly with [Potter API](https://www.potterapi.com/), which requires the one extra step of acquiring an access token.

## Concepts

- Passing data between applications in a language-agnostic way using JSON.
- Syntax of the JSON language, and its limitations.

## TODO

- [ ] Use `curl` and Python's `json.tool` on the command line to retrieve data from SWAPI.
- [ ] Walk through the information contained in the SWAPI data, and how it's formatted.
  - What do the curly braces `{}` mean? What kind of data structure are they like in Swift (and Python), and what are they called in JSON?
  - What do the square braces `[]` mean? What kind of data structure are they like in Swift, and what are they called in JSON?
- [ ] Use SWAPI to discover information about Star Wars.
  - What year was Luke Skywalker born?
  - What vehicles has Anakin Skywalker used in the series?
  - How many planets does SWAPI have in its database?
