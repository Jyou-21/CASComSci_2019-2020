## Concepts

- Xcode storyboards
- Connecting UI objects to Swift code
- UI object attributes

## TODO

- [ ] Run the `helloApp` iOS app code in Xcode using Simulator.
  - [ ] Review the structure of an iOS app's files.
  - [ ] Read the Swift code in the Controller.
  - [ ] Look through the structure of the Storyboard.
- [ ] Modify the `helloApp` iOS app code.
  - [ ] Change the greeting message.
  - [ ] Add a switch to change it to a goodbye message.
- [ ] Make a counting app.
  - Screen contains a button and a label.
  - The label says how many times the button has been pressed.
  - Every time the button is pressed, the label updates.
- [ ] Begin creating an app that asks the user for their age, then says what year they were born.
  - Screen contains:
    - A way to input the user's age. (A text field is probably easiest, but other options exist.)
    - A button to ask for the birth year.
    - A switch if they've already had their birthday this year.
    - A label to display their birth year.
  - If the user does not enter a valid number for their age, the app should not crash, and the label should display an appropriate message.
