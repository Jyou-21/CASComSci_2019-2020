# 2019-09-10

Riley is out today. He'll be back on 2019-09-13 (Friday).

## Concepts

- Unwrapping Optionals
- Using Github repos to share code

## TODO

- Copy the code from [`optionals.playground/Contents.swift`](optionals.playground/Contents.swift) into your own playground.
- Make the changes described in the code comments to make the last three `print` functions run without errors.
- In a separate text document called `optionals.txt`, answer the following questions:
  1. What kind of value does the function `getFirstVowel` return?
  2. Of the three ways that you unwrapped the value of `firstVowel`, which do you feel was most appropriate for this situation, and why?
  3. This exercise assumes that you do, in fact, have a vowel (of the English language) in your name. What, if anything, would you need to change about the code if your name was "Bj√∏rk" or "Ghrftnx"?
- Submit your work.
  - If you haven't already, create a Github repo for your work in this course.
  - Place your updated playground code and `optionals.txt` into a shared directory with no other files.
  - Submit the URL to your directory on the assignment "Unwrapping Optionals" on the course website.
  - If you're having trouble with submitting via a Github URL, you can instead upload the files directly on the website, with a minor grade reduction.
